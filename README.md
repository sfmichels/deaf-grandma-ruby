Exercise from Learn to Program Ruby

Deaf grandma. Whatever you say to Grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with this:

HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!

unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back:

 To make your program really believable, have Grandma shout a different year each time, maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. 
 
What if Grandma doesnâ€™t want you to leave? When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you.
You have to shout BYE three times in a row.
